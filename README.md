#COVID19 Analysis

### Description

The goal of this project was to understand the global spread and impact of the COVID19 pandemic.  I used data from the World Health Organization and included cases (new and cumulative), and deaths (new and cumulative) as my main metrics of interest.  The following bullets list out my main objectives of this project:
- Understand the spread of the virus by country over time
- Understand which countries have been hit the hardest by the pandemic 
- Understand which countries are currently facing a surge in cases/deaths over the last 2 weeks
